# HEO_Take_Home_Task
Code for Space Missions Analyst Application

## Task:
The International Space Station (ISS) is a multinational project and is the single largest
manmade object in space. Many missions to and from the station occur each year to
transport astronauts and cargo.
####
a. Create a plot showing the mean altitude of the ISS over the past year

## Elements
The code calls on the 'Where the ISS at' open source API that provides information on the ISS for a current or past timestamp (the timestamps are in epoch time). 
####
Two altitudes are taken each day and the average is found. Future development can call for more altitudes per day to gain a more accurate mean
####
A plot of the mean alitiude is created using matplotlib.pyplot
